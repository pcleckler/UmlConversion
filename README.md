# UML Conversion From Code

This project came from reviewing unsatisfactory results with other C# -> UML conversion tools. Conversion from UML to images is currently handled by [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).

## CSharpToUml

This project is for conversion from C# to UML, as the name states. Public classes and interfaces currently handled. Available documentation is pulled in to supply class summary, but current coding does not unpack the contents out of HTML.

## JavaScriptToUmlConversion

This project is a placeholder for JavaScript to UML conversion. The current project uses Microsoft's ClearScript.V8 to load scripts, but no reflection options resulted. Will be rewriting this with a JavaScript parser.
